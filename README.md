## GeoTracking Check
This survey serves as a validation tool for assessing the geospatial capabilities of Cozie. Its purpose is to conduct multiple passes along specific routes to identify discrepancies in longitude and latitude data, while also incorporating supplementary metadata for in-depth analysis of various influences. The primary focus is on outdoor locations and travel patterns following periods spent indoors. Besides the retreived Cozie data the following features are available in form of survey data: tag/q_location_area tag/q_location_time tag/q_connection_network tag/q_connection_people tag/q_envi_traversion tag/q_envi_sky tag/q_envi_rain, as well as some additional features that categorize the run like tag/q_study tag/q_study_amount tag/q_study_setpoint.
