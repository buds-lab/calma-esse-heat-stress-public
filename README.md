## GeoTracking Check
This survey serves as a validation tool for assessing the geospatial capabilities of Cozie. Its purpose is to conduct multiple passes along specific routes to identify discrepancies in longitude and latitude data, while also incorporating supplementary metadata for in-depth analysis of various influences. The primary focus is on outdoor locations and travel patterns following periods spent indoors. Besides the retreived Cozie data the following features are available in form of survey data: `tag/q_location_area` `tag/q_location_time` `tag/q_connection_network` `tag/q_connection_people` `tag/q_envi_traversion` `tag/q_envi_sky` `tag/q_envi_rain`, as well as some additional features that categorize the run like `tag/q_study` `tag/q_study_amount` `tag/q_study_setpoint`.
